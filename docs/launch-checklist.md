# MS LAB — from prototype to public launch

The site is live on **https://mslab.ee** since 08.10.2026, on Maria's accounts (Vercel team `ms-lab`, project `mslab`, Hobby; how it is set up and deployed: `docs/deploy.md`), still as a **prototype** for Dim and Maria only. This list collects everything that must happen before real visitors arrive. Sources: the final whole-branch review and the build ledger of phase 1, and the clean-up after the move from Cloudflare Workers to Vercel (03.10.2026).

The switches below are **Vercel environment variables** (Project → Settings → Environment Variables, or `vercel env add`), not wrangler settings. A change reaches the site with the next deployment, so redeploy after changing one.

## 1. Accounts and switches
- [x] Done 08.10.2026: Vercel (team `ms-lab`, project `mslab`, its Git integration with `mslabinformation-collab/mslab`, the domains and the variables), Cloudflare (the R2 bucket `mslab-media`), Railway (project `mslab`), Resend (`send.mslab.ee`) and Bunny (library 773592) are Maria's; the data was copied (a Postgres dump; the old bucket was empty). The review comments live in Postgres (`kv_entries`).
- [x] Done 08.10.2026: `SITE_URL` is https://mslab.ee, and `mslab.ee` and `www.mslab.ee` are on the Vercel project (`docs/deploy.md` section 4).
- [ ] Public launch: delete `SITE_GATE` in Production of Maria's Vercel project and redeploy (the coming-soon page goes; `PREVIEW_SECRET` may stay).
- [ ] Before the public launch (phase 2c), still open from the final review of the branch:
  - the password inputs of Minu andmed (`PasswordSection`) and the login page are controlled React inputs; make them uncontrolled (read at submit) as defence in depth, so a password never sits in React state;
  - asking a fresh e-mail code before a password is set or changed (design idea, the owner decides; today the session alone is enough, and the change is mailed to her);
  - the Russian texts of the newsletter popup row (Hüpikaken → Uudiskiri: kicker, title, text; they are database content, not the dictionary) go to the native-speaker check in §9.
  - the campaign popup (Hüpikaken → Kampaania) still opens 6 s after the newsletter's landings (`/?uudiskiri=loobutud` of the unsubscribe link; `/?uudiskiri=kinnitatud` of an old confirmation link), over their notice: skip it on those landings as the newsletter popup does (`CampaignPopup`, one line);
  - the newsletter's own mail counter is 25 a day (25 sign-ups: since 09.10 a sign-up sends one welcome mail and nothing else); raise it (e.g. 35) if sign-ups outgrow it, within Resend's 100 a day (§7).
- [ ] `MARIA_EMAIL` (Vercel env var) and the Telegram chat (`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, or the `tg:chat` row in `kv_entries`) → Maria's address (today: Dim's).
- [ ] **Rotate the Telegram bot token** (BotFather `/revoke` gives a new one) and update `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` on Vercel; redeploy. The current token was copied to Vercel while the site moved.
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_REVIEW_TOOLS` → "0" in `app/next.config.ts` (removes the review comment widget and its anonymous Telegram ping).
- [ ] Remove noindex: the `X-Robots-Tag` rule in the `headers()` of `app/next.config.ts` (keep `frame-ancestors` and `Referrer-Policy`), `ROBOTS` in `app/src/middleware.ts` (its redirects set their own header), `public/robots.txt`, the `robots` metadata of the pages; check the headers on the deployment afterwards.
- [ ] New OG image for the final home page (`public/og.jpg`; strip metadata with `tools/strip_provenance.py`).
- [ ] Cloudflare clean-up: done 08.10.2026 for the Workers `mslab-web` and `mslab-guide`, the Hyperdrive config, the D1 database `mslab-next-tags`, Dim's R2 bucket `mslab-media` and the KV namespace (checked against `kv_entries` first). Left: delete the R2 bucket `mslab-next-cache` once its one-day expiry has emptied it.
- [ ] After a few weeks: remove Dim's old Vercel project (the mslab.diipsolutions.eu redirect) and the `mslab` CNAME in the Cloudflare zone `diipsolutions.eu`.

## 1b. Domain, e-mail and Google (mslab.ee is at Elkdata today: DNS, MX, old site)
- [ ] Confirm with Maria: does a mailbox on mslab.ee exist (e.g. info@mslab.ee — MX points to Elkdata, but the mail service may not be ordered) and who can log in to Elkdata.
- [ ] Business Google account with the mslab.ee address as login (owned by Maria, Dim added as user/owner) for Search Console, Business Profile, Analytics if used.
- [ ] Search Console **now** on the current mslab.ee (Domain property, DNS TXT at Elkdata): collect the old site's indexed URLs and traffic → 301 redirect map from old WordPress URLs to the new pages at launch.
- [x] Done 08.10.2026: mslab.ee and www point at Vercel; the DNS stays at veebimajutus (Elkdata), the old WordPress site is gone and the mail records were kept.
- [x] Done 08.10.2026: the site's e-mail is on `send.mslab.ee` in Maria's Resend (DKIM/SPF/return-path records). Do not use Resend as Maria's personal SMTP (shared 100/day free quota).
- [ ] Optional: mailbox in Gmail via forwarding + "Send mail as" through the mailbox host's SMTP.
- [ ] Analytics: prefer a cookieless one (Vercel Web Analytics on Hobby, or Cloudflare Web Analytics' script, which works without proxying the site) over GA4. Check the Hobby quota first.

## 2. Stay inside the free plans (owner rules out paid plans)
Vercel Hobby limits that matter here: **1 million function invocations a month**, **100 GB of transfer a month**, **4.5 MB request body** (the image upload limit in the app is 4 MB), **cron jobs once a day at most** (the one cron, `/api/cron/sweep`, is daily). Railway and Resend have their own quotas (Resend Free: 100 mails a day).
- [ ] **Check Vercel's terms for the launch**: the Hobby plan is meant for personal, non-commercial use. A public business site that sells courses may fall outside it; read the current terms (and ask Vercel if unsure) before real visitors arrive. If Pro turns out to be required, that is a decision for Dim: the owner has ruled out paid plans so far.
- [ ] After the first weeks of traffic read Vercel → Usage (invocations, transfer, ISR writes) against the limits. The home page prefetches about 30 internal links per first visit; pages served from the ISR cache are cheap, the admin and the API routes are invocations. A scanner asking for made-up slugs under `koolitused/`, `uudised/` or `ostukorv/` costs one invocation and one ISR write per address (each gets its own cached 404), and so does one under `konto/kursus/` (each gets its own cached account shell); other unknown paths are rewritten to `/leidmata` and do not.
- [ ] Abuse/quota hardening: Turnstile (free) on public forms; a global daily cap on outgoing mail (Resend Free: 100/day); the rate limits now live in Postgres (`kv_entries`, Railway), so a flood of form posts costs invocations and database writes: a Vercel Firewall rule (or Attack Challenge Mode) for scanners.
- [ ] Every Next.js upgrade (the version is pinned): run the unit tests, in particular the canary in `app/tests/unit/r2.test.ts` (it fails with a message when Next changes the fetch behaviour the R2 workaround depends on), and the production-build e2e (`E2E_PROD_BUILD=1`, which tests the freshness contract: the next public request after an admin save shows the change). That run depends on `app/tests/e2e/page-cache.cjs`, which wraps Next's own file cache through an internal module (`next/dist/…/file-system-cache.js`) and has no unit test of its own: if Next moves those internals the production e2e fails loudly, so fix the wrapper there. The R2 canary builds Next's fetch by hand and cannot see how a new version wires it, so also check once the upgrade is live: a missing `/media` key answers 404 within a second (`docs/deploy.md` section 3).

## 3. Decisions for Maria
- [ ] Do unpaid (awaiting prepayment) registrations hold a seat? Then: capacity warning when confirming, and re-enable or keep off the public seat revalidation.
- [ ] CTA wording: hero "Leia **oma** koolitus" vs popup "Leia **enda** koolitus".
- [ ] Step/module numbers in JetBrains Mono — keep or switch to Jost.
- [ ] Newsletter CSV: comma or semicolon (Excel in Estonian locale).
- [ ] Video hosting for e-courses (est. 500 h): R2 + own HLS encoding (~$8–32/mo storage, free egress) vs Bunny Stream (~$11–20/mo + delivery) vs Cloudflare Stream (~$150/mo). Vercel Hobby's 100 GB transfer rules out serving video from Vercel itself. Decide when the prototype is ready for testing; test with one real video.

## 4. Content
- [ ] Native-speaker review of all Russian texts (UI dictionary and the drafted sample content); RU city names.
- [ ] Real photos and texts from Maria (originals, not Telegram-compressed); trainer works gallery with her own work.
- [ ] Three dark hero slides on the current DB: phone focal point ≈ 90% in /admin/avaleht.
- [ ] ET copy pass ("1 kuud" for accessMonths = 1, etc.).

## 5. Polish and robustness (accepted for the prototype)
- [ ] Unsaved-changes warning on in-admin navigation (beforeunload only today).
- [ ] Slide/FAQ field errors keyed by index (wrong row after reorder).
- [ ] Newsletter links via GET (mail scanners) → interstitial with a POST button; rotate/hash the token. Two links: the old confirm link (`/api/newsletter/confirm`, only in mailboxes from before 09.10) and the unsubscribe link of the welcome mail (`/api/newsletter/loobu`), which deletes the row on a plain GET (HEAD and prefetch do nothing): a mail scanner that follows the links of a new welcome mail would unsubscribe the subscriber at once. Check it live in §7's mailbox test; if it happens, the link opens a page with a button that POSTs.
- [ ] Static guard: `"use server"` only under `server/actions`.
- [ ] Scroll-lock layout shift on Windows (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`).
- [ ] Accessibility: explainer card focus; FavouriteButton double announce; "Eemalda lemmikutest" only in `title`.
- [ ] `keepNamesTogether` joins 3+ Title-case words (join pairs only); RU waitlist pill 1 px past the row border at ≥1000 px.
- [ ] Check in the Vercel runtime logs that the work scheduled with `after()` (the sign-in e-mail, the form notifications) completes when many requests arrive together: no mail missing from a burst.
- [ ] `global-setup` cannot see a reused dev server's env → make `sendMail`/`sendTelegram` skip in development builds before `MARIA_EMAIL` points to Maria. The same blind spot covers uploads: a reused dev server that was started with `R2_*` in its shell writes the e2e's uploads to the real bucket.
- [ ] Render race after an admin save: a page that is requested between the database write and the revalidation can be cached stale until the next revalidation (accepted: no cheap fix in Next 16.3.8). Option: shorten the layout's safety-net revalidation after checking the Hobby ISR write quota.

## 6. Phase 2 (engineering)
- [ ] Extract `usePublicForm` + `<Honeypot/>` before payment forms (six forms repeat the pattern).
- [ ] Delete the unused Task 5 write helpers in `src/db/queries/admin.ts` and `registrationSchema`.
- [ ] Migration with FK / token indexes; lowercase e-mails on write.
- [ ] e2e: guard Playwright `request`/`page.request` against non-GET on remote targets.
- [ ] `frame-ancestors 'none'` for admin if no same-origin framing is needed any more.
- [ ] CI drift check: `drizzle-kit generate` must produce no diff.
- [ ] R2 media deletion (uploads are never deleted today) — remember Vercel's CDN copies of `/media` images are immutable for a year (a deleted image can stay visible there until the copy expires).

## 7. Phase 2a (client accounts)
From the final review of phase 2a (04.10.2026); the merge-blocking items were fixed on the branch.
- [ ] One counter for every mail the site sends (logins, confirmations, Maria's notifications, deletion and change-request mails, admin logins, newsletter welcome mails): a hard cap of about 95 a day with a share per kind, and the 3 000 a month. Until then the visitors' mail is counted on **two** `mail_quota` counters (since phase 2c), and a full one never stops the other (M1):
  - the shared one (row `<day>`): a login mail or a confirmation that carries a code stops at 60 a day, a registration or request confirmation without a code at 30 (the prepayment details are in it);
  - the newsletter's own (row `<day>:nl`): 25 a day, for the welcome mail. A sign-up (one step since 09.10: it subscribes at once and sends only the welcome mail) uses one place, so 25 sign-ups a day get their welcome; the rest are subscribed all the same but get no welcome mail (the footer's answer is the same).
  - The two counters allow at most 85 counted mails a day of Resend Free's 100. Maria's notifications (one per form sent) and the admin logins are not counted, so a very busy day (dozens of registrations plus a full newsletter day) can still pass 100: Resend then refuses the rest. Watch the logs for `daily mail cap reached` (no address in it).
- [ ] Check live that the login and confirmation mails arrive and render (big code, one button) in Gmail, Outlook.com and an Estonian ISP mailbox (the newsletter's welcome mail too: the unsubscribe line is the last before the signature, its link works), and whether a mail scanner's plain GET uses up the login link and code (and, one device only, ends the student's session). If it does, the link opens a "Logi sisse" page that POSTs, like the newsletter interstitial in §5 (M2).
- [ ] iPhone Safari deletes localStorage after 7 days without a visit while the cookies stay: a signed-in student's "Ava minu konto" then shows the login form instead of her account (safe fallback). Fix: with the hint set and nothing remembered, forward to `/konto#email=…` and let the dashboard compare with `client.email`.
- [ ] Shared device: the remembered address is the last one a code was asked for, not the signed-in one (B asks for a code and leaves; B's "Ava minu konto" then opens A's account). Keep the signed-in address in its own key, written only from account answers.
- [ ] Watch Vercel Usage for made-up slugs under `konto/kursus/` (each renders and caches its own shell; §2's scanner note) (M3).
- [ ] Decide Maria's reply address and set `replyTo` on the visitor mails; replies go to the unread sending address today (M5).
- [ ] Native-speaker pass on the Russian account texts and mails: «лист ожидания» vs «списке ожидания», "оплатите предоплату" → "внесите предоплату", the request mail's "Запрос отправлен. Мария скоро ответит." (M6).
- [ ] `admin-auth.spec` under `E2E_PROD_BUILD=1`: skip its devLink tests there, and delete leftover admin tokens in `global-setup` (they block the admin sign-in for 15 minutes) (M9).
- [ ] `clients.email` lower-case enforced by the database (a CHECK or a unique `lower()` index), with §6's migration (triage row 4).
- [ ] Partial unique index `client_sessions(client_id) where ended_at is null`: the one-device rule in the schema too (row 8).
- [ ] `set local lock_timeout` at `lockAddress`, so a stuck lock cannot hold a request for its whole 30 s (row 10).
- [ ] Accessibility: the account banner (`role=status`) is inserted with its text and may not be announced; add it to §5's list (row 29).
- [ ] Probe live whether a cached 404 page keeps an unknown address's query (task-11 probe 5); if it does, strip queries on unknown addresses with a 303 (row 40).
- [ ] Õpilased list turns into cards below about 1360 px, Maria's laptop width; check on her screen (row 45).
- [ ] Admin copy: "(mustand) (avatud kuni …)" has two pairs of brackets in the grant select (row 49).
- [ ] Maria fills "Ettemaksu juhised" in Seaded (until then every unpaid card and mail says "Maria saadab sulle arve …").
- [ ] Maria saves the real "E-koolituse tingimused" text in Seaded before the first real "Ava ligipääs" (the seeded one ends "(Näidistekst — Maria täiendab.)").
- [ ] Before renaming `middleware` to `proxy` (a Next 16 build warning): the 303 shell defence lives there; rerun the task-11 probes after any rename.
- [ ] Watch the logs for `[account] login request rate limited`: the per-IP login limits (10 and 20 per 10 minutes) may bite students behind a mobile carrier's shared address (CGNAT).

## 8. Phase 3a (lessons and video)
- [ ] The library is Maria's (`mslab`, id 773592, 08.10.2026). Check that `BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID`, `BUNNY_API_KEY`, `BUNNY_TOKEN_KEY` and `BUNNY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are set in Production of Maria's Vercel project (`vercel env ls production` lists the names); without them the admin says "Video seadistamata" and students "Video lisandub peagi".
- [ ] First live uploads: the four first-use checks of `docs/deploy.md` section 10 (the browser console during the first upload, R2 keeping the file name on a signed download, the player address answering without a redirect, the shape of an upright phone clip).
- [x] Done 08.10.2026: the library's allowed domains are `mslab.ee` and `www.mslab.ee`, and the webhook URL's host is mslab.ee (`docs/deploy.md` section 10).
- [ ] Bunny library → allowed domains: replace the stale `mslab-five.vercel.app` with the project's current `*.vercel.app` address (or remove it).
- [x] Done: the library is on Maria's Bunny account from the start (08.10.2026).
- [ ] After the first month read Bunny's bill (the estimate is about €5–15 a month at 500 hours watched) and Vercel's function invocations (a watching student makes about 240 progress calls an hour).
- [ ] Migration 0006 (drops `courses.modules`) only after 3a has run for a few days with no rollback planned: the code first, then the migration (plan 2026-10-05-phase3a, Task 12 step 11).
- [ ] Accepted limit: the iPhone's own full-screen video player shows no watermark (the page's "Täisekraan" keeps it).
- [ ] Accepted limit, narrowed in phase 2c: the player takes back a forward jump past what she has watched, and the server keeps at most twice the real time since the lesson was opened plus 30 s, so a video lesson cannot be completed in less than about half its length. A script can still report steadily at 2× without watching: "done" means "the time was spent with the lesson open", not "watched".
- [ ] Accepted limit: the player's height is capped to leave room for the buttons below it (about 400 px reserved, 240 to 540 px high), so on a small laptop screen, with a 4:3 video or a lesson title that runs to two lines, "Täisekraan" can sit below the fold.
- [ ] Bunny's embed host is `player.mediadelivery.net` (the old `iframe.mediadelivery.net` player goes in early 2027): nothing to do, noted.

## 9. Phase 2c (Maria's feedback of 06.10.2026)
- [ ] Native-speaker check of the Russian texts phase 2c added: `account.lesson.seekLocked`, the `account.dashboard` resume texts (`resumeTag` … `finished`), `newsletter.sentTitle`, `newsletter.sentText`, `newsletter.popupSent` (the answers after "Подписаться"), `newsletter.unsubscribedTitle`, `newsletter.unsubscribedText` (the notice after the unsubscribe link), `newsletter.codeLine`, `mail.welcome.*` (`unsubscribe` is the new last line of the welcome mail), `forms.newsletterConsent`, `account.passwordMail.*`, `account.details.password.*` (`removeFailed` is the line after a failed removal; `none` is the sentence the owner chose), and the login page's password texts (`account.login.toPassword` … `passwordLocked`).
- [ ] Native-speaker check of the newsletter popup's Russian texts (Hüpikaken → Uudiskiri, the Russian kicker, title and text): they live in the database (the `campaign` row of kind newsletter; the seeded ones are drafts), not in the dictionary, so Maria or the checker edits them in the admin.
- [ ] Maria fills Seaded → "Tervituskood" (empty: the welcome mail still goes out, without the code lines; the old confirmation link then shows no code and sends no mail) and applies the code on her invoice.
- [ ] Every newsletter Maria sends needs a way out. The welcome mail has one; her own mailings, sent from a mailing tool with the CSV of Uudiskiri, do not get one from the site: the CSV has no token column. Either the tool's own unsubscribe link (and Maria deleting that address in Uudiskiri by hand), or add a column with each subscriber's `/api/newsletter/loobu?t=<token>` link to the CSV.
- [ ] Maria chooses in Hüpikaken what the home page shows (Kampaania / Uudiskiri / Väljas); the newsletter popup's picture is a sample one until she uploads her own.
- [ ] Bunny's speed menu must stop at 2×: the server's progress clock assumes it (`TOP_SPEED` in `app/src/domain/lessons.ts`). If Bunny ever offers more, raise the factor to the top speed.
- [ ] Accepted: a password is optional and per address; there is no "forgot password" link (the code login is the way back); admins have no passwords.

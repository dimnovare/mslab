 * Specs that change the public site's content (a seed course's title, badge, gallery and order; sessions in the
 * calendar; hero slides, FAQ, practice packages, the trainer page, posts, the campaign and settings). They restore
 * everything afterwards, but while they run another test could see the change (the catalogue counts 6 cards, the
 * calendar 8 rows, the hero 5 slides). So they run after all other tests: "chromium-edit" and "mobile-edit" are the
 * teardown projects of "before-edits-*", on which "chromium" and "mobile" depend, and a teardown starts only when every
 * project depending on its setup has finished. Unlike `dependencies`, a teardown also runs when an earlier test failed.

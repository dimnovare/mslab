// The coming-soon gate (hotfix 08.10): mslab.ee serves the new site while its content is still sample content, so with the
// setting SITE_GATE on, a visitor is answered with the coming-soon page (app/tulekul/[locale]) whatever the address,
// and only an admin's preview cookie (lib/preview-cookie.ts) lets the request through to the site as it is. Unset (local
// development, the e2e run) the site behaves exactly as without it; the launch removes SITE_GATE. The decision is a plain
// function (tested without Next.js); src/middleware.ts answers with it.

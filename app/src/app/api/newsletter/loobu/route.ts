/**
 * The unsubscribe link of the welcome mail (`?t=<the subscriber's token>`, one-step newsletter, 09.10), in two steps so that a mail gateway
 * that opens every link of a mail (Mimecast, Proofpoint, some Defender setups) unsubscribes no one:
 * - GET only shows a page with one button (server/unsubscribe-page.ts), in the row's language when the token belongs to a row, else in
 *   Estonian; it changes nothing, whoever or whatever fetches it, so no prefetch special case is needed. A token that cannot be one gets
 *   the page without the form.
 * - POST (the button's form field `t`) is the only thing that deletes the row, and sends the visitor to the home page in the row's language
 *   with the notice ?uudiskiri=loobutud. Unsubscribing is idempotent and reveals nothing: an unknown or malformed token, or a button pressed
 *   twice, gets the very same answer in Estonian. Only when the database could not be reached is the visitor told so (?uudiskiri=viga),
 *   never that she is unsubscribed when she is not. A cross-site POST is refused with 403, like the other routes' writes. The row's
 *   once-a-year welcome mark goes with it, so signing up again later gets a fresh welcome.
 * - HEAD (below) does nothing.
 * The page's headers other than the type and the cache are next.config.ts's (headers() replaces a route's own): noindex, and Referrer-Policy
 * same-origin. That must never become no-referrer: a form posted from such a document carries `Origin: null`.

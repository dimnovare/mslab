/**
 * Logout (POST from the button in the admin area): deletes the session row, clears the `__Host-mslab_admin` cookie and
 * the coming-soon gate's preview cookie (`mslab_preview`, server/preview.ts), and sends the browser to /admin/login. POST
 * only, so that a link or an image on another site cannot sign anybody out, and a POST from another site (Origin) is
 * refused with 403.
 *
 * Deliberately not wrapped in withAdmin: a session that has expired, or whose address has left the allow-list, must still
 * be able to clear its cookies and get to the login page instead of a JSON 401. A request without the cookies just gets
 * the redirect (a cross-site POST does not carry them, SameSite=Lax); each cookie the request carries is cleared, the
 * preview cookie also without a session. The static check in tests/unit/admin-guards.test.ts covers app/admin and
 * app/api/admin; this route lives under app/api/auth because it is part of signing in and out.

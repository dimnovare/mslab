 *   after "Logi välja" keeps nothing): a `favourites` list in it (the dashboard's, Lemmikud's) becomes this
 *   browser's copy for the course pages' ♡, and the favourites this browser kept before signing in are merged into the account, once per
 *   browser, whichever account page loads first.
 * - 401 `{ reason: "replaced" }` (another device signed in): "replaced", for the page to say so with one "Saada uus kood".
 * - any other 401 (never signed in, logged out, 180 days unused): "signedOut", and the visitor is sent to the login page of
 *   `locale` (the page's own; without it, the locale of the address) — `redirect: false` keeps them here.
 * - 404 with the API's own JSON answer (`{ ok: false, … }`: there is nothing for this client, e.g. an e-course without access), when the
 *   page asked for it with `notFound: true`: "notFound", for the page to say so; a quiet reload that learns it moves the page there too
 *   (it is an answer, not a failure). Any other 404 (a page of the platform, no JSON) and every 404 for a page that did not ask are
 *   plain failures, as below.
 * - anything else, no answer, or a 200 without a JSON object: "error"; `reload()` asks again.
 * A 401 has cleared the hint cookie, so the header is told to show "Logi sisse" again, and this browser's copy of the favourites is forgotten.
 * `reload({ quiet: true })` asks again in the background: the page keeps showing what it has ("ready" and the old data)
 * until the new answer is in, and a failure leaves it as it is; a 401 still ends the page as above.
 * `reload()` answers with a promise: true when the server gave an answer the page now shows (also a 401 or a 404 that ends it), false
 * when it did not (no answer, an error status, a broken body: a quiet reload then leaves the page as it was). A reload that a newer
 * one overtakes answers false.

// `test` for every spec that opens site pages.
// - Every test is its own visitor: the forms allow 5 submissions per 10 minutes per visitor IP (KV rate limit), and
//   against the local server (`next dev` or `next start`) the IP comes from x-forwarded-for, so repeated runs do not hit
//   the limit. On Vercel the edge sets x-forwarded-for itself and this header changes nothing.
// - Against anything but the local dev server (E2E_BASE_URL + E2E_ALLOW_REMOTE=1), every request but GET and HEAD is
//   blocked in the browser: a deployment's
//   database and notifications are real, and tests must never submit to it. Tests that submit call submitsForms()
//   and are skipped there.
// - The campaign popup (Task 14) opens on the home page 6 s after it loads and would cover whatever a test does there.
//   Unless a spec asks for it (`test.use({ campaignPopup: … })`), every page starts as if this browser session had seen
//   it already (sessionStorage "mslab-camp": the site's own once-per-session rule). "site" keeps the site's 6 s; a
//   number sets a shorter delay in ms through the page's test hook (window.__mslabCampaignDelay).
